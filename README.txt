To run:
	1) Run make in base dir
	2) Type ./procSim programfile.txt to run, where programfile.txt is the name of the file with the assembly code in it.

	All it should spit out is the number of instructions run.

	To see the final results of the registers, the Processor has a .dump() function which prints out the register contents.

	In case the Makefile doesn't work, it should be a simple change for you to get it working.
